# Ethio Fake News Detector (RAG)

A web app that checks news claims written in **Amharic, English, Tigrinya and Afaan Oromo**
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## How it works

1. **Input**: a user submits a news claim in any supported language.
2. **Retrieve**: the claim is embedded with a multilingual model and compared against a
   knowledge base of trusted sources and fact-checks.
3. **Generate**: an LLM reads the claim plus the retrieved evidence and returns a verdict
   (supported / contradicted / not enough evidence) with an explanation.

## Planned stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- Embeddings: multilingual sentence-transformers model
- Vector search: FAISS
- LLM: to be decided
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
